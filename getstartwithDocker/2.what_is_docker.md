## What is Docker ?? 

You can think of Docker as a __lunchbox__ for our application in The Lunchbox we pack not just the main dish which is our code but also all the specific ingredients or dependencies it needs to taste just right now this special lunch box is also magical it doesn't matter where we want to eat at our desk a colleague's desk or have a little picnic no matter the environment or different computers wherever we open The Lunchbox everything is set up just like it is in our kitchen ___it ensures consistency portability and prevents us from overlooking any key ingredients___ making sure our code runs smoothly in any environment without surprises technically that's 

what Docker is it's a platform that enables the development packaging and execution of applications in a unified environment by clearly specifying our applications requirements such as no Js versions and necessary packages Docker generates a self-contained box that includes its own operating system and all the components essential for running our application this box acts like a separate computer virtually providing the operating system run times and everything required for our application to run smoothly
