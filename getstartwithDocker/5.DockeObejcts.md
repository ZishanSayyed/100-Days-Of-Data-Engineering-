## Docker objects
When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects


## Docker Images

Docker image is a lightweight Standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software including the code run times like node.js libraries system tools and even the operating system 

think of a Docker image as a recipe for our application it not only lists the ingredients being code and libraries but also provides the instructions such as runtime and system tools to create a specific meal meaning to run our application and we would want to run this image somewhere right and that's where containers come in		


## Docker Containers

Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image it represents the execution environment for a specific application including its code runtime system tools and libraries included into Docker image

a container takes everything specified in the image and follows its instructions by executing necessary commands downloading packages and setting things up to run our application 	


## Docker Volumn

Docker volume is a persistent data storage mechanism that allows data to to be shared between a dock container and the host machine which is usually a computer or a server or even among multiple containers it ensures data durability and persistence even if the container is stopped or removed think of it as a shared folder or a storage compartment that exists outside the container 		


## Docker Networks


Docker Network it's a Communication channel that enables different Docker containers to talk to each each other or with the external World it creates connectivity allowing containers to share information and services while maintaining isolation think of a Docker Network as a big restaurant Kitchen in a large kitchen being the host you have different cooking stations or containers each focused on a specific meal meal being our application each cooking station or a container is like a chef working independently on a meal now imagine a system of order tickets or a Docker Network connecting all of these cooking stations together chefs can communicate ask for ingredients or share recipes seamlessly even though each station or container has its own space and focus the communication system or the docker Network enables them to collaborate efficiently they share information without interfering with each other's cooking process
