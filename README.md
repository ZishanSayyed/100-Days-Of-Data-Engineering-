## Introduction
Welcome to the "100 Days of Data Engineering" challenge! Inspired by the roadmap shared by Seattle Data Guy in his video [The Fastest Way to Become a Data Engineer in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FVchWw3EbU&list=LL&index=4) - 100 Days Of Data Engineering, this challenge aims to guide you through a structured learning journey in the field of data engineering. The original roadmap was organized in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a5TMdF7Vz-YdvlHXnNHLMeHk7lV-TdRjbPoxMrQ_cSE/edit#gid=0), and I have customized it according to my area of interest. You can find [my personalized roadmap here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JR-_MqxVvnuBcsheMYwonLiV-WdTy7bCLlw8fo8i4MM/edit#gid=0).

## Purpose
The primary goal of this 100-day challenge is not to acquire a certification or rush through topics but to foster __self-improvement, learning, and the development of discipline and consistency__. 
Remember, the intention is to build a habit of daily practice, and if you wish to delve deeper into specific subjects beyond the 100 days, feel free to do so. The journey is about continuous improvement and personal growth.

## Duration
While 100 days might seem like a short period to become a data engineer, the essence of this challenge lies in establishing a routine of consistent practice. The tasks outlined in the roadmap are designed to introduce you to various aspects of data engineering. Post-challenge, you can further explore specific areas based on your interests and needs.
