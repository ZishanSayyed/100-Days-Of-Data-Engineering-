/*

we can use export and import. 
The export and import are the keywords used for exporting and importing one or more members in a module.

Import: You can import a variable using import keyword. 
You can specify one of all the members that you want to import from a JavaScript file.

Syntax:
import member_to_import from “path_to_js_file”;

// You can also use an alias while importing a member.
import Greeting as Greet from "./export.js";


// If you want to import all the members but don’t
// want to Specify them all then you can do that using
// a ' * ' star symbol.
import * as exp from "./export.js"; */




/*
Export: You can export a variable using the export keyword in front of that variable declaration. 
You can also export a function and a class by doing the same.

Syntax for variable:


export let variable_name;

Syntax for function:

export function function_name() {
  // Statements
}
