# Third Normal Form (3NF):

Before going to 3NF we must understand __transitive dependency__:
In a database, a transitive dependency is an __indirect relationship between values in the same table__. 
This causes a functional dependency. To achieve the Third Normal Form (3NF) normalization standard, transitive dependencies must be eliminated.


- A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and not contain any transitive partial dependency.
- 3NF is used to reduce the data duplication. It is also used to achieve the data integrity.
- If there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes, then the relation must be in third normal form


eg:

consider the following table 


| EMP_ID | EMP_NAME  | EMP_ZIP | EMP_STATE | EMP_CITY |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 222    | Harry     | 201010  | UP        | Noida    |
| 333    | Stephan   | 2228    | US        | Boston   |
| 444    | Lan       | 60007   | US        | Chicago  |
| 555    | Katharine | 6389    | UK        | Norwich  |
| 666    | John      | 462007  | MP        | Bhopal   |


- __Candidate key__: {EMP_ID} is a super key

- __Non-prime attributes__: In the given table, all attributes except EMP_ID are non-prime.

- Here, __EMP_STATE & EMP_CITY__ dependent on __EMP_ZIP__ and __EMP_ZIP__ dependent on __EMP_ID__. 
The non-prime attributes (EMP_STATE, EMP_CITY) __transitively dependent on super key(EMP_ID)__. It violates the rule of third normal form.

That's why we need to move the EMP_CITY and EMP_STATE to the new <EMPLOYEE_ZIP> table, with EMP_ZIP as a Primary key.
