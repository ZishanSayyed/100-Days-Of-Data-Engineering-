# What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of __creating a simplified diagram__ of a software/database system and its data elements. It can involve:

-Evaluating data dependencies Explaining how data will be used by the software/database
-Defining data objects that will be stored in a database
-Creating a representation or abstraction of the data, such as a mathematical formula, a statistical model, or a machine learning algorithm 

Data modeling can be used as a __blueprint__ for designing a new database or reengineering a legacy application

A data model can be thought of as a flowchart that illustrates data entities, their attributes and the relationships between entities. __It enables data management and analytics teams to document data requirements for applications and identify errors in development plans before any code is written__.

Data models are a key data architecture component, along with data flow diagrams, architectural blueprints, a unified data vocabulary, and other artifacts.
