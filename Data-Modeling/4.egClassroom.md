# Let's take a example of the classroom and what components it can have and try to build all data modeles around it 

A Class room has data compontents like: 
-Student
-Class
-Professor
-Subject
 and more but for simplicity we are considering only above components 

 Now we try to build all three models using this component and see how our modeling structure improves with each modeling step

## one-to-many relationship:
-Class : Subject: A class is about a single subject, and a subject can have many classes. This is a one-to-many relationship. -Class : Professor: A class can have only one professor, but a professor can teach more than one class (a one-to-many relationship).

## many-to-many relationship:
-Professor : Subject: A professor can teach more than one subject, and a subject can be taught by more than one professor (a many-to-many relationship).
-Class : Student: A student can attend many classes and each class can have many students. This is a many-to-many relationship.
