# What are the different types of data models?

Data modelers use three types of models to separately represent business concepts and workflows,

**1-Conceptual Data Modeling**: 
This is the __first layer of data modeling__, where we focus on abstractly understanding the business concepts and entities. 
It is a high-level view of the entire system, created to help business stakeholders understand the system. 
Conceptual data models often use __ER diagrams or UML diagrams__ to represent entities, relationships, and attributes.

A conceptual data model usually just includes the main concepts (entities) required to store information and the relationships that exist between these entities.
We donâ€™t usually include any details about each piece of information. We can consider the conceptual stage as an initial model, without all the details required to create a database.

The main use of a conceptual data model is to define the scope of a business solution without going into any details.


**2-Logical Data Modeling**: 

This is the __second layer__ of data modeling, where we focus on understanding how the system should be built. 
It is a more detailed view of the data model, __including relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints__. However, it does not consider the specific database management system we'll be using.

A logical data model should contain all the details to define an information domain. However, it does not consider the technologies (i.e. the database and platform) that will be used to implement the model.


**3-Physical Data Modeling**: 

This is the __final layer of data modeling__, where you implement the data model in a specific database management system. 
It involves making decisions about data types, indexing, storage, and performance tuning. The physical data model is a direct representation of the actual database schema.
One big difference between logical and physical data models is that we now need to use table and column names rather than specifying entity and attribute names. This allows us to adapt to the limits and conventions of the desired database engine. We also provide the actual data types and constraints that allow us to store the desired information. Physical data models should be easy to transform into an SQL script that allows us to create the database structure.
