## Technique 1. Introducing a redundant column/Pre-joining tables

This technique can be used when there are expensive join operations and data from multiple tables are frequently used. Here, that frequently used data will be added to one table.

## Technique 2. Table splitting
Table splitting is the process of decomposing a table into multiple smaller tables so they can be queried and managed easily. Table splitting can be done in two ways: horizontal table splitting and vertical table splitting.

### Horizontal table splitting
Splitting table rows into smaller tables. Each table will have the same columns. This approach is useful when data tables can be separated based on regions, physical locations, tasks and many more scenarios.

### Vertical table splitting
Vertical splitting is splitting a table based on columns, applying the primary key to each partition.
