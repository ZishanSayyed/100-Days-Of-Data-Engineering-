# Normalization;

Normalization is a technique used to organize data into multiple related tables to __minimize data redundancy__
normalization is an essential concept in database design that helps us organize data in a way that __minimizes data redundancy and improves data integrity__. 

# How We Do that??
By breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable tables, we can avoid anomalies and improve the overall performance of our database.

# Goals of Normalization:

- __Eliminate Redundant Data__: Ensure each piece of data is stored only once, reducing the storage space and improving data consistency. One reason this was done was because of limitations in terms of server space.

- __Minimize Data Mutation Issues__: Prevent update, insert, and delete anomalies that can lead to inconsistent data. 

- __Protect Data Integrity__: Preserve the natural data relationships and enforce referential integrity. a crucial part of a standard relational database is the fact that if there is an ID that relates one entity to another, it should exist. If there is a transaction ID with a customer ID, the customer needs to exist.


## Normalization involves several stages called "normal forms" (NF). Each form represents a level of database refinement
