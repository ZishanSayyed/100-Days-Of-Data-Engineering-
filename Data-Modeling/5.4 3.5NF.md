## Boyce Codd normal form (BCNF) also known as 3.5NF

BCNF states that every non-key column in a table should depend on the whole primary key, and not on any subset of it. 
This means that there should be no partial dependencies or transitive dependencies in the table. 
A partial dependency occurs when a non-key column depends on only part of the primary key, and 

- a transitive dependency occurs when a non-key column depends on another non-key column that depends on the primary key.

### A table must satisfy two conditions to be in BCNF:
- it must be in 3NF,
- for any dependency, a non-prime attribute should be a superkey.
