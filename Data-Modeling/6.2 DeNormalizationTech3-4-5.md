## Technique 4. Using mirrored tables

- This technique __creates a full or partial copy of an existing table, which will be stored in a separate location and optimized for faster query performance__. 

- Generally, the __mirrored table will be used for read-heavy workloads__ using techniques like creating additional indexes and data partitioning. That mirrored table can create read-heavy processes like analytics queries.

## Technique 5. Materialized views

-Materialized views are __pre-computed query results__ stored in a separate table. 

-They are __typically ‘join’ and ‘aggregation’ queries__ that are quite expensive and result in frequently accessed data. Next time, the database can pull the data from the view when needed rather than execute the same query repeatedly.
