# How the files/dic get stored in Linux:


## when we do ls -l we get a detailed view of files like this eg:

-rw-rw-rw- 1 codespace codespace 1796 Feb  4 14:49  1.FHS.md
-rw-rw-rw- 1 codespace codespace 3295 Feb  4 14:49  2.DirectoryOprations.md

Interpreting the above code:

| file type | owner/root user | group users | others | symbolic link | owner | group | file size  | date |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|-------|------------|------|
| d         | wrx             | w_x         | __x    | 1             | root  | root  | 0          | date |


## Types of file:
